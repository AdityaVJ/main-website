                        When you're new to using the terminal, all of these terms can be a bit confusing. Maybe you want to know what the 
                        Command Prompt or Powershell are on Windows, maybe you want to use the terminal on your Mac, or maybe you've just 
                        installed your first Linux distro and need to figure out how to... do things.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Let's go over some simple explanations of each of these terms. 
                    </p>
                    <br>                        
                    <p>
                        <b>Terminal -</b> A terminal is a text-based program in which you, the user, can input text or commands and see an output. 
                        It emulates the console in a graphical user interface (GUI) so that you can easily use the console from your desktop.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Console -</b> A console is a type of terminal; a physical one. It is the window in which your text-based programs are run. 
                        While a terminal is a GUI application, a console is not.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Command-line (Interface) -</b> The command-line is the area of a terminal or console where you type in commands or text. 
                        Typically, a command will be followed by arguments or values, and the user executes the command by pressing the return key.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Shell -</b> A shell is a command-line interpreter. It takes the commands you input into the terminal or console and translates 
                        them into a language the computer can read and understand. One of the primary purposes of the shell is to start other programs. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>(Command) Prompt -</b> A command prompt is a short text message at the beginning of the command-line. The text displayed in the command 
                        prompt will change depending on a few things such as the current user's username, the operating system, or terminal being 
                        used. Typically, the command prompt will contain your username followed by an @, followed by the computer name, followed 
                        by the path to the directory you are currently located in. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Bash -</b> Bash is the default shell for most Linux operating systems. It was the default shell on macOS until it was recently 
                        replaced with another shell, Zsh, as the default. Bash is portable, meaning it runs on just about every version of Unix 
                        and can also be run on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Bash is the interface to a computer. Bash 
                        commands are the commands you input into the shell, and processes can be automated via Bash scripting, when Bash commands 
                        are written out in a plain-text file to create shell scripts, and are then executed in the command-line.
